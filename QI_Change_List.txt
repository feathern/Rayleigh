Rayleigh Subroutine call flowchart necessary for QI implementation:

Implementation noted with initials BM, KA, or NF.

From High to Low:

Controls.F90 --
	     1. Create qi_flag (Done), default (False).
	     2. Add to numerical control namelist (Done)   
	     3. Add to restore numerical defauts subroutine (Done)

Main.F90 --
Call Main_Input() --
             1. Get qi_flag state (Automatic)

Sphere_Spectral_Space.F90 --
Call Post_Solve() --
             1. If necessary, reset linear equations (relies on Linear_Solve_QI.F90)
	     
Linear_Solve_QI.F90
             1. Added Use_QISolve() routine.
             2. Added qi_flag and k.eq.zeq, and related allocation conditionals to
	     	Allocate_LHS, Deallocate_LHS, Reset_Equation_Coefficients
             3. Implicit Solve has similar flags and call to QI_Solve, which wraps to QI_Pack solver routines.
	     4. LU_Decompose has similar flags and call to QI_Decompose, which wraps to QI_Pack LU decomposition routines.	
	     5. Add_implicit_term_QI 

To Configure:
./configure --with-qipack=/home/feathern/devel/qi_pack -mkl --FC=mpif90 --with-fftw=/custom/software/fftw/3.3.8
