    "This notebook provides an example of how to prepare Rayleigh Spherical_3D data output for volume rendering with yt. Then we show a few simple examples of how to create volume renderings, modify the transfer function, and manipulate the camera angle. \n",

    "## About yt and installing yt\n",
    "*This section is under development*\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed in Python, yt is an analysis and visualization toolkit for volumetric data. To install yt on your machine and activate it, visit this website: [https://yt-project.org/doc/installing.html](https://yt-project.org/doc/installing.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing your Rayleigh Spherical_3D output for volume rendering with yt\n",
    "*This section is under development*\n",
    "\n",
    "Rayleigh's Spherical_3D quantities are output in a spherical grid. Many visualization software packages do not fully support spherical grids. One solution is to interpolate the quantities onto a uniform Cartesian grid with dimensions XxYxZ. Quantity values outside the spherical volume are given values of zero and can easily be made transparent using an appropriately chosen tranfer function when rendering the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare your Spherical_3D output: Interpolating Spherical_3D quantities onto a uniform Cartesian grid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the directory **/Rayleigh/post_processing/kyle_interp** onto your local system\n",
    "2. Compile the executable. We use the gcc compiler: **make -f Makefile.gfortran** \n",
    "3. Create a directory called **vis_test** (or something equally suitable) in which to run the interpolator. Copy the executable **interpolator.app** and the **input** file from **/Rayleigh/post_processing/kyle_interp** there.\n",
    "4. Create a directory in **vis_test** called **Spherical_3D**. In directory **Spherical_3D** copy the 3D spherical output files you wish to interpolate, including the **_grid** file.\n",
    "5. In the input file, modify the uniform radial grid resolution **nr** appropriate for your files, choose the resolution **ncube** of the resulting Cartesian cube, and modify the iteration range. When interpolating a single file, **initial_iteration** and **final_iteration** should be the same.\n",
    "6. Run the interpolation code: **./interpolator.app XXXX** (Where **XXXX** is the four digit quantity code of the quantity you wish to interpolate. For example, to interpolate a radial velocity spherical 3D output of quantity code **0001**, type: **./interpolator.app 0001**) \n",
    "7. If the code executed correctly, you should have a new file in your **/vis_test/Spherical_3D** directory called **_cube**. These files are what you will import into this notebook. \n",
    "8. Copy your new **_cube** files into the directory where you will run this Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "## Reading in your prepared data and creating simple yt visualizations\n",
